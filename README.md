# rehost-of-tabsuspender-by-hau-hau
Taken down from addons.mozilla.org while they're working on their next version, some of us still use it. The other addons available don't suit my needs

Their current license text is below. I'm unsure of whether this gives me permission to include the images by Melania Furmaniak, but have left the .XPI-file as downloaded from AMO, prioritising the ability to give people access to the extension. The images are available at https://github.com/Hau-Hau/firefox-tab-suspender/tree/develop/assets at any rate, and have been for over 2 years

The XPI-file is a ZIP-file, and can be unzipped and its contents inspected as such
